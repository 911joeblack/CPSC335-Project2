  ## Algorithm 1: Run String Encoding
  ## Algorithm 2: Finding Target Substring
    * Invoke your Python configuration to run script. Example:
      * 'python3 CitySearch.py'
    * CitySearch is not for import and uses no special libraries
    * Note to Grader:
      * Professor Akwafuo indicated to another student the afternoon before the due date that the implementation should parse a text file. This is inconsistent with the project requirements as outlined by the project description given to us. This implementation uses hard-coded lists and prints the solution lists in terminal.
  ## Algorithm 3: Merging Techniques
