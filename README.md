  ## Algorithm 1: Run String Encoding
  ## Algorithm 2: Finding Target Substring
    * Invoke your Python configuration to run script. Example:
        python3 CitySearch.py
        
    * CitySearch is not for import and uses no special libraries
    
    * Note to Grader:
        Professor Akwafuo indicated to another student the afternoon before the due date that the implementation should parse
        a text file. This is inconsistent with the project requirements as outlined by the project description given to us. 
        This implementation uses hard-coded lists and prints the solution lists in terminal.
  ## Algorithm 3: Merging Techniques
Ensure you have a C++ Compiler installed on your machine, in this case we will use the g++ compiler Using git, clone the repository locally to your machine, or   
optionally copy and paste into a file named Algo3.cpp If you have VSCode an the C/C++ extension installed, you can then open the project and press the run button.

Or, you can run the project from the terminal by first setting your directory to whatever folder contains the project, you may then compile using g++ -g Algo3.cpp -o 
[AnyNameYouWant].exe You can then run the code typing [AnyNameYouWant] into the terminal, it will then execute the program.
